First type a title in the <b>title</b> box, type the text you want to encrypt in the <b>text</b> box, and type a password that only you know in the <b>master key</b> box. In this way, a .txt file will be created and 
the text you wrote in encrypted form and also the title you wrote will be accessible. Then, if you write the title and also the correct master key, you will be able to access the encrypted text.
